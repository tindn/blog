This is one of the two follow ups I have from reading through [William MacAskill's AMA on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3fngcb/iama_cofounder_of_two_nonprofits_with_over_400/){:target="_blank"} that I [posted]({% post_url 2015-08-04-william-macaskill-reddit-ama %}){:target="_blank"} about. While reading through the comments, I found these question and answers, which I think are very encouraging.

If you don't want to read through my screenshot, the gist of the conversation is that user IAmGabensXB1 asks "What is the best way for a software developer to transition into nonprofit organizations?" This is a question that I have asked myself, and been looking for an answer as well. So I was glad to see a few other people jumping in to answer his/her question. The sentiment is nothing new or groundbreaking. It mainly is that there's great need for the skill in the nonprofit world, yet it doesn't quite pay enough to jump into it. And it was also nice to read that u/IAmGabensXB1 is also constrained by visa issue like I am.

Anyway, a few people suggested some resources for doing side work in the nonprofit world, which are [.impact Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/dotimpact/){:target="_blank"} and [Taproot Foundation](http://www.taprootfoundation.org/){:target="_blank"}. I haven't had much time to thoroughly look through either links, but they look very interesting. Personally, I have come across a tech conference in California called [Nonprofit Software Development Summit](https://aspirationtech.org/events/devsummit15){:target="_blank"} organized/hosted by [Aspiration Tech](https://aspirationtech.org){:target="_blank"}. I'm hoping to be able to attend the upcoming 2015 summit in November.

So I hope these resources have been useful for someone. Leave a comment or so if you agree/disagree, or if you have anything else to share.
