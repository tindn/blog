My previous post about [Effective Altruism TED Talk]({% post_url 2015-05-27-hedonic-treadmill-effective-altruism %}) IÂ mentioned a few useful websites, [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) and [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/). The author of these websites, William MacAskill, did an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit recently. Quite an interesting read. Check it out:

Also, here's a good read from The Atlantic, written on the same topic and on William: [The Greatest Good](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/what-is-the-greatest-good/395768/).

Enjoy,
