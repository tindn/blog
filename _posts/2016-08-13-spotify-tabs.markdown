Spotify is an amazing app and service. However, it's hard to browse music in spotify.
The music browser in spotify works like a web browser, clicking on links will allow you to explore even more music.
This is awesome. I wish they would allow multiple tabs, so that as I explore more music,
I can keep track of things I want to listen to while browsing even more music. 
I know there's a "Add to queue" functionality, but it's not quite the same.
