This is the second follow up post from the [William MacAskill's AMA]({% post_url 2015-08-04-william-macaskill-reddit-ama %}){:target="_blank"}.

I have quite a keen interest in the challenge of sending money internationally, especially by immigrants as they try to send their hard earned money back to their home countries. This is a significant issue, and it can have very big impact on the global economy, as discussed in this [TED talk I posted]({% post_url 2014-12-21-sending-money-home %}){:target="_blank"} a while back.

William MacAskill, during his Reddit AMA, has also pointed out a couple products and organizations that are focusing on solving this issue. One of them is <a href="http://www.sendwave.com/" target="_blank">Wave</a>, and the other is <a href="http://www.thesegovia.com/" target="_blank">Segovia</a>. Check them out.

Here's the comment by William
