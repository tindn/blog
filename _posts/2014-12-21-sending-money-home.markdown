This talk has been very influential on me lately. In this talk, Dilip Ratha tells a story that is very common and very close to me, as well as many others to live abroad; that is the story of remittances, and more generally the story of sending money internationally. To many people, myself included, sending and receiving money across the international borders are often a pain that we have to tolerate. The challenges of international monetary transfer come from strict regulations, lack of competition, and generally a sense of bias against remittances. In his talk, Dilip not only outlines the existing challenges with staggering statistics, he also emphasizes the importance and significance of remittances to the global economy. Dilip then goes on to explore a number of creative solutions that can change the current situation, and tops it off with an emotional personal story that myself and many others could easily relate to.

This talk has been more than just another TED talk for me. Watching this talk has helped me realize the current state of international money transfer and motivated me to look further into the subject. I think this problem is worthwhile not just for the significance of remittances to the global economy (the econ nerd in me is definitely excited), but also for the fact that it pertains largely to a group of people who are often at the disadvantage. I'm talking about millions of workers living abroad, working hard jobs, earning low incomes and trying to save as much as possible to send money home. These people are often taken advantage of, shunned upon in both the host countries and home countries and have very little voice in protecting themselves.

As I further explore this topic, I will be updating this post, as well as writing new ones. So stay tuned.
