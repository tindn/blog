> What most defines the 11 million undocumented immigrants in America is not illegality but undaunted courage and ambition for a better life. What separates their families from most of ours is simply the passage of time â€” and the lottery of birth.


I was re-reading an old article saved on [pocket](http://getpocket.com){:target="_blank"} called [Immigration Enriches You and Me](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-immigration-enriches-you-and-m.html){:target="_blank"}. Originally published in 2014 after the executive order by President Obama on immigration, this article is still relevant today as the 2016 US presidential election heats up. And, I have a feeling, the US and other countries around the world will continue to grapple with this issue for years to come. It's a short article, so I would encourage you to read it. I was quite tempted to post this on Facebook, where I know it will get more readership. However, I'm a bit wary of posting on Facebook, and do not want to be one of those trying to spread uninformed political messages.
