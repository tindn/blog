Came across this TED talk this morning, and it turned out to be one of those talks that really energize me and give me so many ideas. It is exactly what I need for my slump lately.

Many ideas where explored, and many questions answered in this talk. It really gives me the inspiration to have a good career in software (for now) while helping others, and exactly how to do that.

Here are some of the resources mentioned in the talk.

80,000 hours: [https://80000hours.org/](https://80000hours.org/){:taget="_blank"}

Give well: [http://www.givewell.org/](http://www.givewell.org/){:taget="_blank"}

I will write more about these resources and the ideas I have later.
