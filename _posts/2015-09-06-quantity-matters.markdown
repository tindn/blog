Recently came across this article on the New York Times about spending not just quality (or actually, don't focus too much on quality at all) but quantity of time with your family and friends.

[The Myth of Quality Time](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-the-myth-of-quality-time.htm)

It's definitely worth a read. For someone like me who has been away from home for too long, this is a very good advice. I have spent much time thinking about spending quality time (irony) with my family to make up for the last 10 years being away from home, and it has put a lot of pressure on my visits without much "quality" in the end.

Here are a few worthy quotes from the article
<blockquote>With a more expansive stretch, there’s a better chance that I’ll be around at the precise, random moment when one of my nephews drops his guard and solicits my advice about something private. Or when one of my nieces will need someone other than her parents to tell her that she’s smart and beautiful. Or when <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/opinion/sunday/bruni-the-gift-of-siblings.html" target="_blank">one of my siblings</a> will flash back on an incident from our childhood that makes us laugh uncontrollably, and suddenly the cozy, happy chain of our love is cinched that much tighter.

But people tend not to operate on cue. At least our moods and emotions don’t. We reach out for help at odd points; we bloom at unpredictable ones. The surest way to see the brightest colors, or the darkest ones, is to be watching and waiting and ready for them.</blockquote>
Certainly it is very difficult to plan for such a long time together, and it grows more difficult with distance and size of the family. However, by understanding this, and by placing a priority on this time over other things, I am sure many can make this happen. And even if for one reason or another such an extended stay is impossible, maybe it's better to have the short time actually being together rather than planning something special that often brings stress and eludes the real moments that come out of the ordinary.
