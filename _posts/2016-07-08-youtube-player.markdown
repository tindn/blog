The youtube player is great. It's quite advanced, and has a lot of capabilities one would need watching a video. At the bottom left corner, the elapsed/total time is display. 
This is the standard display of a video player control. However, whenever I watch a youtube video, I often find myself wondering how much time there is left on the video, and having to do some substraction
to find out the time remaining. Why does the player not display time remaining/total time instead? Isn't the time remaining bit of information more useful to the person watching than the time
elapsed? Most often, the person watching knows where they're at in the video. Time elapsed can be useful in determining where you are in the video, however, this information is already being display 
on the progress bar. By hovering on the progress bar, the player will also display the exact time and screenshot at that moment (this, I think, is one of the most amazing features of the youtube 
player). So, in summary, I think the youtube player should display time remaining/total time instead of time elapsed/total time.
